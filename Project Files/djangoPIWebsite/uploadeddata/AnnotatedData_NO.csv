no,@ Apple  @AppleSupport  I really  hate  the fact that I spent all this money on the  iPhone   X  for the camera to be so trashy! The @SamsungMobile  phones camera is so much better. You guys really disappointed me.
no,so in order to download a video from my  iphone  I first need to update iTunes which cannot be updated until I update the version of OS  X  that I'm running. This is why people  hate  computers

no,I  hate  that  iPhone  XR
no,@ Apple  I downloaded the latest update for my  iPhone   X  and now its a  useless  brick. The battery is supped up twice as fast or more. Im having to charge it 3 times a day now instead of once. I thought youd given this game up?? #battery  #iPhoneX  #iphone  #apple   #batterylife
no,is my  iphone   x  the only one that sometimes has the sc image quality at like 420p why is it so  bad  sometimes

no,@ AppleSupport  I  hate  my  iphone   x  and my wife does too. Why does it take longer to unlock the  iphone   x  with facial recognition and having to swipe up. Than with  iphone  7 plus with thumb print recognition and no swiping up. It doesnt make sense for newer technology to be slower.

no,Im gonna need @Apple  to do better with these damn phones. Ive had 4 iPhones it takes for me to get the  iPhone   X  to  hate  my damn phone. Soon all the insides will be on the outside with this glass back being broken and costing $500+ to fix   #annoyed  #iphoneX
no,The one crisis I have with that is  iphone   X  only has one lightning port so if I need to also charge it with my portacharger on the go im screwed lol apple is ruining all their shit first that then the new macbooks are terrible with falling apart keyboards and a  useless  touch bar

no,Who thought it would be a good idea to have something you swipe up from the bottom to access seeing as the  iPhone   X  and XS goes to the home screen when you do so.... welcome to the new  useless  app from @Honda  @HondaInAmerica pic.twitter.com/DLBBKAirRr
no,I was at a lunch and looked around to notice that of 10 people... only one had upgraded to the  iphone   X  and it kind of hit me... how  bad  are apples  iphone  sales right now that they basically have to go all in on a netflix clone streaming service...  $ appl
no,i  hate  the way  iphone   x  videos look
no,Same Id  hate  to have this phone ( iPhone   x ) and get absolutely nothing should be like a bundle but without the vbucks included if you get what I mean

no,change to A5... seems decent tho.  iPhone   X  is too  expensive  ;(
no,Oh really? As far as I'm aware the  Iphone  7-8+ X -Xr-XS-XS got increasingly  expensive  as each new model released. Sure it went down eventually
no,I have  iPhone   X . I started with android HTC Droid 1 & 2 and have since been iOS for  8+ years. Contemplating a switch to Samsung s10 or s10e.

no,Shes owns an  iPhone   X  but the camera quality is still  bad  
no,I filed a complain about my  iPhone   X  so they can ship me out a new one (and a different color bc I  hate  the color I have rn but there was no more other colors) AND THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE SHIPPING THE SAME PRODUCT   ugh all the complaining for nothing
no,To create new airpods which re so simular to the old ones spending on this a few years. Apple disappointed fisrt when released the last one  iphone  XS which is so simular to the  X  one but much more  expensive  and closed  X  one trading.
no,I was surprised it has the latest processor.  Plus the apple pencil.  I like the feel of the newer apple pencil in my hand since it is squared off but you cant have everything.  I  hate  face id on my  iPhone   X .  Half the time I hold it too close and it fails.
